# The Lucky App

## Getting Up and Running
1. This project was built using `yarn` as the dependency manager. To ensure that the correct packages are installed, please ensure you have `yarn` installed.
2. The backend and frontend are separated and must be started separately. This was done to avoid muddling together of the two projects and to keep the two codebases more organised.
3. **Backend**
   1. To get the backend up and running, start by opening `CMD` or `Terminal` window in the `backend` folder of the project (ie, `cd ./backend`).
   2. Install the application dependencies using `yarn install`.
   3. Start the server by running `yarn start:dev`.
   4. _Detailed Backend instructions can be found [here](/backend/README.md)_
4. **Frontend**
   1. Without closing the terminal where the backend server is running, open a new `CMD` or `Terminal` window in the `frontend` folder of the project (ie, `cd ./frontend`).
   2. Install the application dependencies using `yarn install`.
   3. Start the server by running `yarn start`.
   4. _Detailed Frontend instructions can be found [here](/frontend/README.md)_
